# Animated-Scene
This project essentially based on practicing working with shapes on Zelle Graphics in order to produce a final scene influenced by Animated Intro Credits for Film and Television. My main influence for this project was the “Big Fish Movie Title Sequence”. To portray this influence I was able to create a pattern with multiple circles at different widths, and colors in order to create a futuristic rainbow. This art was composed using the graphics module on Python. In addition to this I was finally able to create a final animated scene which contained my buildings, windows, my rainbow and the ender eye which acts as the sun.
